# Remoto
Employee Onboarding Platform

## The problem
Onboarding process include various manual processes which includes extending offer letters,
sending account credentials and follow-up emails. As this is a repetitive process, by implementing
onboarding automation company could easily process the on boarding process of its employees.

## Goals and objective

1. To provide a solution to automate the tasks such as sending offer letters, employee desk setup,
sharing/explaining the policies and work ethics.
2. To implement a systematic method to retrieve all the important employee documents and
storing them with minimal or no human intervention and with minimum hard
copies/paperwork involved.
3. To lay out a software solution to automatically creating all the needed new employee accounts
and sharing the credentials with them.
4. To decrease turnaround time of the onboarding process.

## Description of the project

This is project created for submission as final year project for our college. We worked on requierement analysis, dscussed architecture, connected with people to know their onboarding experience and take feedback on our project features.

## Motivation bbehind this idea
Onboarding a new employee involves a large amount of paperwork and processes that are repetitive and time consuming. Structured onboarding program helps organizations to have greater new employee productivity and also keeps track of each employee and their contribution.
A memorable onboarding experience helps employees feel welcome and sets some sort of emotional tie to the company within the first months of job. To overcome this problem, this project will replace the manual onboarding system with robotic software which will reduce stress and workload of an employee, human resource team and the organization.
