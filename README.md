## Required Feature Implementation

### **Single Sign-on (SSO) / AD Authentication with SSL/TLS Encryption**  
  We implemented **Google Single Sign-On (SSO)** for both sign-up and sign-in, offering users a seamless and secure authentication experience. The integration ensures that users can log in using their Google credentials, reducing the need to remember multiple passwords and improving security. This implementation uses **SSL/TLS encryption** to protect sensitive data during
 the authentication process, ensuring all communication between the client and server is encrypted and secure.

### **Application / Web Portal for Viewing/Browsing Enterprise Employee Data with SSO Roles**  
  The application supports **two roles**: **Employee** and **Admin**. Each role is associated with a different user interface, ensuring that both employees and administrators have tailored experiences.
  - **Employee Role**: Employees can access their personal data, view their onboarding progress, salary details, upload required documents, and track the completion of their onboarding tasks.

  The UI is dynamically adjusted based on the assigned role, providing relevant features and maintaining a streamlined user experience.

### **GitHub (or Other Repo) Integrated into SSO**  
  We integrated the project repository on **GitHub** (or another version control platform) with the Single Sign-On (SSO) system, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and contribute to the repository. This integration simplifies user management and improves security by tying access to authenticated roles, avoiding the need for separate repository credentials.

### **Jenkins Integrated into SSO and GitHub Repo**  
  The project is set up with **Jenkins** for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Jenkins is integrated with both the **SSO** and **GitHub repositories**:
  - **Jenkins Pipeline**: Whenever there is a push to the GitHub repository (for example, after a new feature or bug fix is committed), Jenkins automatically triggers a build. This ensures that the latest changes are continuously tested and deployed without manual intervention.
  - **Webhooks**: We used GitHub webhooks to notify Jenkins of any changes in the repository, initiating the build process automatically. This setup allows for real-time monitoring and rapid feedback on code changes, ensuring that the project is always in a deployable state.

### **Additional Integrations / Features** 
  The project also includes several advanced features and integrations to enhance security and usability:
  - **Document Repository (AWS S3)**: For secure document storage, we integrated **AWS S3** buckets. This allows employees to upload and store necessary documents, such as IDs, contracts, and tax forms, securely. The data stored in S3 is encrypted, ensuring compliance with industry-standard data protection regulations. S3 also offers scalability, making it easy to handle a large volume of documents as the application grows.

  - **Serverless Functionality (AWS Lambda)**: To minimize server management and optimize cost efficiency, we used **AWS Lambda** for serverless execution. Lambda functions handle specific tasks like sending emails, processing uploaded documents, or triggering workflows, without the need to provision or manage traditional servers. This also improves application performance by enabling on-demand resource scaling. When a user clicks on the user panel on the left, the Room Component is triggered. This component sends a request to the WebSocket API to establish a connection. Once the connection is successfully created, a Lambda function is invoked to save the necessary chat room and user information into DynamoDB. When a user sends a message, a request is sent to the REST API to store the chat message in the database.

  - **Database (DynamoDB)**: We used **AWS DynamoDB**, a fully managed NoSQL database, to store and retrieve data in a highly available, scalable manner. DynamoDB is ideal for applications requiring low-latency data access, such as handling real-time onboarding information. With DynamoDB, we can easily scale as the application grows while ensuring fast and reliable access to employee data.

This comprehensive set of features enhances both the user experience and the security of the platform, making it a robust and scalable solution for employee onboarding.
